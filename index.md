<h1>Visualize Your Network</h1>
This open source hardware project brings the popular ESP8266 WiFi module to a small, low cost display board for simple 8 bit display.

Example Arduino firmware is a Network Traffic Visualizer that captures packets on the board's active WiFi channel and displays the "packets per second" on the 8 LEDs, much like a VU meter.
