Thanks for stopping by and checking out this project! Here I hope to answer some questions you might have about what's going on here.

<h2>What did you build?</h2>
This project is a custom designed Printed Circuit Board and Assembly that brings together an ESP8266 WiFi Module and 8 Light Emitting Diodes to allow anyone to experiment with writing Arduino code for the popular WiFi enabled microcontroller and have a simple LED display to learn all about shift registers.

<h2>What do you use it for?</h2>
I wrote a small Arduino sketch that visualizes the amount of network traffic on a given WiFi channel. I wanted a desktoy with some satisfying blinking lights. I also love using it as a conversation piece about network security, since the WiFi module can operate in promiscuous mode: it doesn't need to be connected to a network to see the network packets.

<h2>Why Open Source Hardware?</h2>
This means that I have shared all the files used to design and manufacture this custom Printed Circuit Board so that others can recreate it, modify it, and learn from it.

<h2>What is this website?</h2>
I built this website to act as a companion to the source files, so that it's easier to find the information people might want without digging through source files. It is written as a Jekyll static site and hosted on Github as a Github Pages project. Learn more about [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). You can find the source files for this website on the `gh-pages` branch of this [repository](https://github.com/stasiselectronics/8BitWiFiVisualizer/tree/gh-pages).

<h2>Want to learn more?</h2>
Read the schematics, assembly instructions, and explenations of how the firmware works.
