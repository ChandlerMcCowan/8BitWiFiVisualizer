Thanks for stopping by and checking out this project! Here I hope to answer some questions you might have about what's going on here.

<h2>What did you build?</h2>
This project is a custom designed Printed Circuit Board and Assembly that brings together an ESP8266 WiFi Module and 8 Light Emitting Diodes to allow anyone to experiment with writing Arduino code for the popular WiFi enabled microcontroller and have a simple LED display to learn all about shift registers.

<h2>What do you use it for?</h2>
I wrote a small Arduino sketch that visualizes the amount of network traffic on a given WiFi channel. I wanted a desktoy with some satisfying blinking lights. I also love using it as a conversation piece about network security, since the WiFi module can operate in promiscuous mode: it doesn't need to be connected to a network to see the network packets. 

<h2>Why Open Source Hardware?</h2>
This means that I have shared all the files used to design and manufacture this custom Printed Circuit Board so that others can recreate it, modify it, and learn from it. 

<h2>What is this website?</h2>
This is the documentation site for an open source electronics project. I built this website to act as a companion to the source files, so that it's easier to find the information people might want without digging through source files.
