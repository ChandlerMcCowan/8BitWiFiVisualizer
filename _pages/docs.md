## Hardware
This is a custom designed Printed Circuit Board, so there are a few parts needed to go from abstract connections to components on copper.



<div style="font-size: 125%;" markdown = "1">
|[Schematics]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/board/schematics/){: .btn .btn--info .align-center }|The circuit design starts here, take a look to see how all the parts connect together and what their values are.
|[Layout]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/board/layout/){: .btn .btn--info .align-center }|Here you can find the size and shape of the board, mounting hole locations, and more details about the physical properties of the PCB.
|[Assembly]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/board/assembly/){: .btn .btn--info .align-center}|Want to build your own? Here you can find the instructions on how to hand solder the surface mount components.
|[Components]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/board/components/){: .btn .btn--info .align-center }|Here you can find the Bill of Materials, and more information of the specific components that are on the board.

## Firmware
The ESP82266 WiFi module can be programmed with the Arudiuno language and IDE. This makes getting up and running a snap with plenty of existing libraries for complicated functions.
